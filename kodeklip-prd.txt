KodeKlip Product Requirements Document

1. Vision: Slay the Context Bloat Dragon
To give developers a lightning-fast, command-line tool that provides surgical control over their LLM context, making their models smarter, faster, and more accurate by injecting only the most relevant code.

2. Guiding Principles
- Surgical Precision, Not Brute Force: Extract smallest, most relevant code snippets
- Developer Control: No magic, explicit search, selection, and approval
- Speed is a Feature: Instantaneous workflow that never breaks flow state
- Frictionless Workflow: 10x more efficient than manual clone/find/copy/paste

3. The Problem (Context Bloat)
- Automated MCPs dump irrelevant code into LLM prompts
- Degrades model performance with noise
- Wastes context window on useless information
- Increases API costs

4. Core Features
- kk add <repo_url>: Clone library into local knowledge base
- kk list: View cached libraries and index status
- kk update: Keep libraries up-to-date
- kk find <alias> "<query>": Instant ripgrep search
- kk index <alias>: Pre-process for semantic search
- kk find -i --semantic: Interactive TUI selection

5. Technical Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Build the Foundation
- Project initialization with poetry/uv
- SQLite + SQLModel state management
- Git operations with GitPython
- Basic repo commands (add, list, update, rm)
- Keyword search with ripgrep integration

Phase 2: Interactive TUI (Killer Feature)
- Two-pane Textual interface
- Left pane: scrollable search results
- Right pane: syntax-highlighted preview
- Navigation and multi-select functionality
- Clipboard integration with formatting

Phase 3: Semantic Search Intelligence
- tree-sitter parsing for precise code chunks
- SentenceTransformers embeddings
- FAISS vector indexing
- Semantic search integration with TUI

Phase 4: Public Launch
- Comprehensive testing with pytest
- Professional README with problem/solution narrative
- GitHub Actions automation
- PyPI publishing
- Community launch
